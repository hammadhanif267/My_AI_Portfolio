## **Project_01**
> **I developed a flask-based House Price Prediction App that predicts house prices using a trained machine learning model. Users enters the area in the sqaure(ft), and the app returns an estimated price instantly. It combines a clean user interface with backend ML processing to deliver accurate, real-time predictions.**

## **Project_02**
> **I developed a Flask-based Student Marks Prediction App that predicts a student's marks based on input features like study hours, attendance, and past performance. It uses a trained machine learning model to provide real-time score predictions through a simple and intuitive web form. The app demonstrates the integration of predictive analytics with a clean Flask frontend for educational insights.**

## **Project_03**
> **I built a Flask-based voice bot that allows real-time voice interaction through a web interface. It uses speech recognition to convert spoken input into text, processes it using natural language logic, and responds with text-to-speech output. Flask handles the backend routing, making the bot responsive and easy to deploy in a browser environment.**

## **Project_04**
> **I developed a diabetes prediction web app using Flask that allows users to input health data such as glucose level, BMI, age, pregnancy count, blood pressure, and sugar level. The app uses a trained machine learning model to analyze this data and predict the risk of diabetes. Flask manages the web interface and seamlessly connects the user input to the model, delivering instant and user-friendly predictions.**

## **Project_05**
> **I developed a Flask-based image generation web app that allows users to enter text prompts, which are processed by an AI model to generate corresponding images. The app captures user input through a simple web interface, sends it to a backend image generation model (e.g., Stable Diffusion or DALL·E), and displays the generated image in real time. It demonstrates how Flask can integrate AI-powered visual creativity into interactive web applications.**

## **Project_06**
> **I developed a Flask-based text-to-speech web app that converts user-inputted text into spoken audio using a TTS engine. The app features a simple interface where users type text, which is processed on the backend to generate and play speech. It demonstrates how Flask can be used to integrate speech synthesis into web applications, enabling accessible and interactive voice features.**

## **Project_07**
> **I developed a Flask-based word cloud generator that takes user-submitted text and visualizes the most frequent words in a dynamic cloud format. The app uses natural language processing to filter common stopwords and emphasizes important terms with larger font sizes. It demonstrates how Flask can combine text analysis with interactive visual output for insightful data representation.**

## **Project_08**
> **Stock Market Analysis App is an interactive web application built using Streamlit that allows users to analyze historical stock market data. With features like dynamic stock selection, customizable date ranges, and interactive visualizations (line charts, moving averages), this app provides an intuitive way for users to explore stock price trends. The data is fetched in real-time from the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance), ensuring accuracy and reliability.**

## **Project_10**
> **Speech-to-Text App is an interactive Streamlit application that transcribes spoken words into text using the SpeechRecognition library. Users can either record their voice or upload audio files to generate accurate text transcripts — useful for transcription, accessibility, or note automation tasks.**

## **Project_11**
> **Heart Disease Prediction Model is a machine learning project designed in Jupyter Notebook that predicts the risk of heart disease based on various medical features such as age, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, and more. Multiple ML algorithms were compared to find the best-performing model, providing insights useful in healthcare prediction systems.**
