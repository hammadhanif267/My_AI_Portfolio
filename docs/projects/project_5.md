### ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Model &nbsp; <i class="fas fa-heartbeat"></i>

A machine learning-based project developed using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health indicators. This project uses supervised learning algorithms to train on healthcare datasets and provides prediction accuracy along with performance evaluation metrics.

#### 🔧 **Features & Functionalities:**
- 📊 **Data preprocessing and cleaning**
- 🧬 **Feature selection and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- 🤖 **Machine Learning model training** (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- 📈 **Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**
- 🔍 **Confusion matrix and ROC curve plotting** for performance visualization
- 💡 Suggestions for possible improvement via deployment using Streamlit or Flask (for future enhancement)
